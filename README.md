## Eye-tracker based on Raspberry Pi

###### An eye-tracker is a device for measuring eye positions and eye movement. The glasses-type is a glasses-like type of Eye-tracker wearing like glasses.

This project of mine comes from an innovative experimental project of undergraduates, and uses funds of Hunan Normal University.
